#' Prediction for SEIRfansy Model
#' 
#' This function is used to predict the total reported as well as unreported case 
#' counts, total recovered, and total deaths.
#'
#' @param data (mandatory): input the training data set. If the model is 
#' Multinomial then the data matrix should contain the 3 columns Confirmed, 
#' Recovered, and Death. If the model is Poisson or Binomial, then the data 
#' should contain only the column Confirmed. Note that the names of 
#' the columns must be the same as stated above.
#' @param data_init (mandatory): These are the initial data values 
#' provided by the user as a numeric vector of length six. The entries should be 
#' the Total Confirmed, Total Recovered, Total Death, Daily Confirmed,
#' Daily Recovered, and Daily Death for the Starting Date. Note: If the starting total 
#' confirmed is 0, please replace it by 1.
#' @param init_pars NULL (default): If not equal to NULL, then the user can give a user input initial 
#' parameters which should consist of the initial values of the time varying beta, 
#' proportion of testing for the different periods.
#' @param N (mandatory): The population size.
#' @param plot TRUE (default): If estimate = FALSE, this will give two plots. One is 
#' the panel plot for total cases, total recovered, total death, and total 
#' confirmed if the model is Multinomial. Otherwise it will give only a plot for total 
#' confirmed when the model is binomial or Poisson, and the second plot is the plot 
#' of untested, false negative, and reported cases. And when estimate = TRUE, 
#' it will give two other plots along with the previous two plots. One is the 
#' box plot for basic reproduction number and the other one is the trace plot for 
#' the convergence of the MCMC parameters.
#' @param T_predict It is the number of days that we want to predict after the train 
#' period. The value of T_predict should be greater than or equal to the number 
#' of rows of `data_test`.
#' @param period_start The total time period is divided into small periods depending 
#' on the lock down measures imposed by the government. So this is a numeric vector consisting 
#' of the start dates for the different time periods.
#' @param estimate TRUE (default): If it is TRUE then it will run the MCMC algorithm 
#' to estimate the parameters. If it is FALSE, then the user needs to give 
#' input the parameter values in the pars argument.
#' @param pars = NULL (default): If estimate = FALSE, then the user needs to 
#' input the parameter estimates.
#' @param data_test NULL (default): Otherwise need to give the 
#' test data for comparing with the model estimates.
#' @param auto.initialize TRUE (default): This is the option for using a mle 
#' based initial parameter.
#' @param ... arguments passed to the function SEIRfansy, model_initializeR 
#' and model_plotR which are used for initializing the parameters. The 
#' parameters are described below:
#'            \itemize{
#'                 \item{niter: }{1e5 (default): Number of iteration for the MCMC 
#'                 metropolis hasting algorithm.}
#'                 \item{BurnIn: }{5e4 (default) This is the Burn-In Period for 
#'                 the MCMC algorithm.}
#'                 \item{model: }{"Multinomial" (default): This is the likelihood 
#'                 function that will be used. There are three options available 
#'                 including "Multinomial", "Poisson", and "Binomial".}
#'                 \item{alpha_p: }{0.5 (default): It is defined as the ratio of 
#'                 rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients to that 
#'                 by false negatives. We have taken $\alpha_p < 1$ as patients 
#'                 who are tested positive are subjected to quarantine where the 
#'                 chance of spreading the disease is less than that of false 
#'                 negative patients who are mostly unaware of their infectious nature. 
#'                 So, false negative individuals continue to spread the disease 
#'                 freely at a higher rate than tested positive individuals.}
#'                 \item{alpha_u: }{0.7 (default): It is defined as the  scaling 
#'                 factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals. 
#'                 $\alpha_u$ is assumed to be < 1 as U mostly consists of 
#'                 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases who are known to spread 
#'                 the disease at a much lower rate than those with higher levels 
#'                 of symptoms.}
#'                 \item{beta_1: }{0.6 (default): It is the scaling factor for 
#'                 rate of recovery  for untested individuals. $\beta_1$ is  
#'                 assumed to be less than 1. The condition of Untested individuals 
#'                 is not so severe as they consist of mostly asymptomatic people. 
#'                 So, they are assumed to recover faster than the Current Positive ones.}
#'                 \item{beta_2: }{0.7 (default): It is the inverse of the scaling 
#'                 factor for rate of recovery for false negative individuals.  
#'                 $\beta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. It is assumed that the 
#'                 recovery rate is slower than the detected ones for the False 
#'                 Negative ones because they are not getting any hospital 
#'                 treatment.}
#'                 \item{delta_1: }{0.3 (default): It is the scaling factor for 
#'                 death rate for undetected individuals. $\delta_1$ is assumed 
#'                 to be less than 1. Similarly, for the Untested ones, the death 
#'                 rate is taken to be lesser because they are mostly asymptomatic. 
#'                 So, their probability of dying is much less.}
#'                 \item{delta_2: }{0.7 (default): It is the inverse of the scaling 
#'                 factor for death rate for false negative individuals. $\delta_2$ 
#'                 is assumed to be less than 1. Same as before, the death rate for 
#'                 False Negative ones are assumed to be higher than the Current 
#'                 detected Positive as they are not receiving proper treatment.}
#'                 \item{lambda: }{1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural birth rate. 
#'                 The value given here as the default value is the world's common 
#'                 birth  rate.}
#'                 \item{mu: }{1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural death rates. 
#'                 This is assumed to be equal with natural birth rate for the 
#'                 sake of simplicity.}
#'                 \item{D_e: }{5.2 (default): Incubation period.}
#'                 \item{Dr: }{17.8 (default): Mean days until recovery for positive 
#'                 individuals.}
#'                 \item{f: }{0.15 (default): False negative probability of RT-PCR 
#'                 test.}
#'                 \item{mCFR: }{NULL (default): (It is calculated from the data by default) 
#'                 It is defined as the ratio of the total reported deceased cases 
#'                 and the total removed cases until that day.}
#'                 \item{init.exposed.ratio: }{3 (default): This is the scaling 
#'                 factor for the calculation of the initial number of exposed 
#'                 people from the sum of the initial number of unreported, 
#'                 reported people.}
#'                 \item{init.confirmed.ratio: }{0.15 (default): This is the initial 
#'                 value of the probability of being tested.}
#'                 \item{opt_num: }{100 (default): The number of times an user 
#'                 wants to run the mle optimization before deciding on the best 
#'                 initial parameter.}
#'                 \item{trace_plot.common_axis: }{FALSE (default): This will give 
#'                 the trace plot for the convergence of the MCMC estimated time 
#'                 varying parameters.}
#'                 \item{save plot: }{TRUE (default): It is the option for saving
