#' Estimate SEIRfansy Model Parameters
#' 
#' This function is used to estimate the different parameters of interest like 
#' the time varying transmission rates, proportion of reported cases, and the 
#' basic reproduction rates.
#'
#' @param N (mandatory): The population size.
#' @param data (mandatory): If the model is Multinomial, then the data matrix 
#' should contain the 3 columns Confirmed, Recovered, and Death. If the model 
#' is Poisson or Binomial, then the data should contain only the column Confirmed. 
#' Please ensure that the names of the columns are exactly as stated above.
#' @param data_init (mandatory): These are the initial data values 
#' provided by the user as a numeric vector of length six. The entries should be 
#' the Total Confirmed, Total Recovered, Total Death, Daily Confirmed,
#' Daily Recovered, and Daily Death for the Starting Date. Note: If the starting total 
#' confirmed is 0, please replace it by 1.
#' @param init_pars NULL(default): If not equal to NULL, then the user can give a user input initial 
#' parameters which should consist of the initial values of the time varying beta, 
#' proportion of testing for the different periods.
#' @param niter 1e5 (default): Number of iterations for the MCMC Metropolis Hastings 
#' algorithm.
#' @param BurnIn 5e4 (default): This is the number of burn-in iterations for the MCMC algorithm
#' @param model "Multinomial" (default): This is the likelihood function that will 
#' be used. There are three options available: "Multinomial", "Poisson", or "Binomial".
#' @param plot TRUE (default): This will give the box plot for the basic reproduction 
#' number for the different periods.
#' @param auto.initialize TRUE (default): This is the option for using a mle 
#' based initial parameter.
#' @param period_start The total time period is divided into small periods depending 
#' on the lock down measures imposed by the government. So this is a numeric vector 
#' consisting of the start dates for the different time periods.
#' @param ... arguments passed to the function model_initializeR and model_plotR 
#' which is used for initializing the parameters. The parameters are 
#' described below:
#'            \itemize{
#'                 \item{step_pars: }{init_pars/500 (default): It is the variance 
#'                 of the proposal distribution for the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm 
#'                 which is assumed to be a Random Walk.}
#'                 \item{alpha_p: }{0.5 (default): It is defined as the ratio 
#'                 of rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients to 
#'                 that by false negatives. We have taken $\alpha_p < 1$ as patients 
#'                 who are tested positive are subjected to quarantine where the 
#'                 chance of spreading the disease is less than that of false 
#'                 negative patients who are mostly unaware of their infectious 
#'                 nature. So, false negative individuals continue to spread the 
#'                 disease freely at a higher rate than tested positive individuals.}
#'                 \item{alpha_u: }{0.7 (default): It is defined as the  scaling 
#'                 factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals. 
#'                 $\alpha_u$ is assumed to be < 1 as U mostly consists of 
#'                 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases who are known to spread 
#'                 the disease at a much lower rate than those with higher levels 
#'                 of symptoms.}
#'                 \item{beta_1: }{0.6 (default): It is the scaling factor for 
#'                 rate of recovery for untested individuals. $\beta_1$ is  
#'                 assumed to be less than 1. The condition of Untested individuals 
#'                 is not as severe as they consist of mostly asymptomatic people. 
#'                 So, they are assumed to recover faster than the Current 
#'                 Positive ones.}
#'                 \item{beta_2: }{0.7 (default): It is the inverse of the 
#'                 scaling factor for rate of recovery for false negative individuals.
#'                 $\beta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. It is assumed that the 
#'                 recovery rate is slower than the detected ones for the False 
#'                 Negative ones because they are not getting any hospital treatments.}
#'                 \item{delta_1: }{0.3 (default): It is the scaling factor for 
#'                 death rate for undetected individuals. $\delta_1$ is assumed 
#'                 to be less than 1. Similarly  for the Untested ones, the death 
#'                 rate is taken to be lesser because they are mostly asymptomatic. 
#'                 So, their probability of dying is much lower.}
#'                 \item{delta_2: }{0.7 (default): It is the inverse of  the 
#'                 scaling factor for death rate for false negative individuals. 
#'                 $\delta_2$ is assumed to be less than 1. Same as before, the 
#'                 death rate for False Negative ones are assumed to be higher than 
#'                 the Current detected Positive as they are not receiving proper 
#'                 treatment.}
#'                 \item{lambda: }{1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural birth  
#'                 rate. The value given here as the default value is the world's 
#'                 common birth rate.}
#'                 \item{mu: }{1 / (66.26 * 365) (default): Natural death rates. 
#'                 This is assumed to be equal with natural birth rate for the sake 
#'                 of simplicity.}
#'                 \item{D_d: }{17.8 (default): Mean days until death for positive 
#'                 individuals.}
#'                 \item{D_e: }{5.2 (default): Incubation period.}
#'                 \item{Dr: }{17.8 (default): Mean days until recovery for positive 
#'                 individuals.}
#'                 \item{f: }{0.15 (default): False negative probability of 
#'                 RT-PCR test.}
#'                 \item{mCFR: }{NULL (It is calculated from the data by default) 
#'                 It is defined as the ratio of the total reported deceased cases 
#'                 and the total removed cases until that day.}
#'                 \item{init.exposed.ratio: }{3 (default): This is the scaling 
#'                 factor for the calculation of the initial number of exposed people 
#'                 from the sum of the initial number of unreported, reported people.}
#'                 \item{init.confirmed.ratio: }{0.15 (default): This is the initial 
#'                 value of the probability of being tested.}
#'                 \item{opt_num: }{100 (default): The number of times an user 
#'                 wants to run the mle optimization before deciding on the best 
#'                 initial parameter.}
#'                 \item{trace_plot.common_axis: }{FALSE (default): This will give 
#'                 the trace plot for the convergence of the MCMC estimated time 
#'                 varying parameters.}
#'                 \item{save plot: }{TRUE (default): It is the option for saving 
#'                 the plots in the directory folder.}
